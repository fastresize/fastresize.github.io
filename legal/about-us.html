<h1>About FastResize</h1>

<p>
FastResize is a simple online image resizing tool created by a small, focused team
with the goal of making image resizing fast, accurate, and privacy-friendly.
</p>

<p>
We built FastResize to solve a common problem — resizing images to exact file sizes
required by job applications, government forms, exam portals, and website uploads.
Many existing tools are slow, complicated, or require uploading images to a server.
We wanted something simpler and safer.
</p>

<p>
FastResize works directly in your browser. Images are processed locally and never
uploaded or stored on any server. This means your files remain private, secure,
and under your control at all times.
</p>

<p>
As a small team, we focus on keeping the tool lightweight, easy to use, and accessible
on all devices. We continuously improve FastResize based on user feedback and real-world
requirements.
</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>
Our mission is to provide a fast, reliable, and free image resizing solution that
anyone can use without technical knowledge or privacy concerns.
</p>
